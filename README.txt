The data reduction is done throughout each days and is splited between the different folders. The first program is used to charecterize the CCD, the second program is used to extcract the spectra, the third is used to calibrate in wavelength the spectra, and the fourth is used to calibrate the science spectrum in flux. The program in the root (spec_comb.ipynb) is used for asytrophysical analysis as well as science spectra merging. The iraf_um package as well as the pydis_um package is Julien Morin's work on redefining specific function from the iraf and pydis packages.
